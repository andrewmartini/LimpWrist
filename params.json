{"name":"Limpwrist","tagline":"Limp Wrist mapping project","body":"content will go here\r\n\r\nI am attempting to create a map of all Limp Wrist concerts since our first show in 1999. This is a map created in Cartodb, synching up with a Google table that I created.  This list is not exhaustive, but contains over 110 shows so far. Some of the locations are only approximate, and some contain links to the show flyers, and videos hosted on youtube. Eventually, the goal is to either have a photo of the venue or a still from the concert in the infowindow header. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
